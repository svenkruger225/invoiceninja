Invoice Settings
================

You can customize your invoice template by adding new details about the client, your company, header and footer information, adjusting the numbering format and more. Any changes you make to the Invoice Settings will apply to all your invoices.

The Invoice Settings page has four sections:

- Invoice and Quote Numbers
- Custom Fields
- Quote Settings
- Default Messages

Invoice and Quote Numbers
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

Want to create your own numbering system for invoices and quotes?

To customize your invoice numbering system, click on the Invoice Number tab on the left.

There are two ways to customize the invoice number: by adding a prefix or creating a pattern.

To add a prefix, select the Prefix button. In the field immediately below, add your chosen prefix. For example, you may choose to add your company initials, such as M&D. The current invoice number appears in the Counter field.

All your invoices will automatically include the numbering change. So if you chose the prefix M&D, your invoice numbers will appear as M&D001, and so on. 3

To create a pattern, select the Pattern button. In the pattern field, enter the custom variable of your choice. For example, if you create a pattern of {$year}-{$counter}, then your invoices will be numbered with the current year and latest invoice number. To view available options for custom patterns, click on the question mark icon at the right end of the Pattern field.

All your invoices will automatically display invoice numbers according to your customized pattern.

To customize your quote numbering system, click on the Quote Number tab on the right.

There are two ways to customize the quote number: by adding a prefix or creating a pattern.

- To add a prefix, select the Prefix button. In the field immediately below, add your chosen prefix. The prefix will appear before the quote number on all your quotes.
- To create a pattern, select the Pattern button. In the pattern field, enter the custom variable of your choice. To view available options for custom patterns, click on the question mark icon at the right end of the Pattern field.  4

All your quotes will automatically display quote numbers according to your customized pattern.

.. TIP:: You can choose to integrate your quote numbers with the invoice number counter. This is an important feature as it allows you to keep the same number when converting a quote to an invoice. So, Quote-001 will automatically become Invoice-001. To number your quotes with your invoice numbering system, check the Share invoice counter button. To number your quotes separately, uncheck the Share invoice counter button. 5

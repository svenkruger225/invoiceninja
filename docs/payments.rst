Understanding the Payments List Page

Overview
^^^^^^^^

The Payments list page displays a summary of all payments once they have been received. Payments are recorded in two ways:

1. **Automatic payment**: If your client has paid you via any of Invoice Ninja’s 45+ payment gateways, the payment will be automatically recorded in the Payments list. You will be notified by Invoice Ninja on your Dashboard page in the Payments table, and also via email (if you have chosen the relevant notification setting on the Settings / Notifications page).
2. **Manual payment**: If your client has paid you via cash, check, bank transfer, credit card or any other payment system not linked to Invoice Ninja, you will need to enter the payment manually on the Payments / Create page.

Whether automatic or manual entry, the Payments list page presents an overview of all payments received in a user-friendly table format. Now, we’ll take you through the various columns in the Payments table from left to right:

- **Invoice**: The invoice number for the payment
- **Client**: The client name
- **Transaction Reference**: If you have been paid automatically via one of the payment gateways, the reference number of the payment generated by the payment gateway system will be automatically recorded here. If you have entered a manual payment, the Transaction Reference will display the information you entered in the Transaction Reference field when entering the payment. If you left the Transaction Reference field blank when entering the payment, the system will automatically display “Manual entry” as the Transaction Reference on the Payments list.
- **Method**: The method of payment used, ie. PayPal, Bank Transfer, Visa, etc
- **Payment**: Amount The payment amount that was received
- **Payment Date**: The date the payment was received

The final column to the right is the Action column. To view the actions, hover your mouse over the Action area of the relevant payment entry and a gray Select button will appear. Click on the arrow at the right side of the button to open a drop-down list. These are the action options:

- **Edit Payment**: Edit the payment information on the Edit Payment page.
- **Archive Payment**: Click here to archive the payment. It will be archived and removed from the Payments list page.
- **Delete Payment**: Click here to delete the payment. It will be archived and removed from the Payments list page.

.. TIP:: To sort the Payments list according to any of the columns, click on the orange column tab of your choice. A small arrow will appear. If the arrow is pointing up, data is sorted from lowest to highest value. If the arrow is pointing down, data is sorted from highest to lowest value. Click to change the arrow direction.

You can also archive or delete one or more payment via the gray Archive button that appears at the top left side of the Payments list page.

Then click on the Archive button, open the drop-down list and select the desired action.

The table will automatically refresh, and will now feature the full list of payments, including current, archived and deleted payments. The status of the archived and deleted payments will be displayed in the far right column.

Enter Payment
"""""""""""""

Once you’ve received payment, you’ll need to enter the payment on the Invoice Ninja system. If your client paid via one of Invoice Ninja’s 45+ payment partners, the system will automatically record the payment and send a downloadable PDF receipt to the client’s email address. If you were paid via cash, check, bank transfer, credit card, credit or any other payment method not automatically linked to the Invoice Ninja system, you will be required to enter the payment. The procedure of entering a payment is simple and lightning fast. Now, we’ll take you through the payment entry process, step by step.

Email Settings
==============

Email communication with your clients is an important part of the Invoice Ninja invoicing process â€“ sending invoices via email, notifying clients that an invoice is due, reminding clients about overdue payments, and more.

With the Email Settings feature, you can specify certain settings and designs for the notification emails your clients receive from your Invoice Ninja account.

The Email Settings page includes two sections: **Email Settings** and **Email Designs**.

Email Settings
""""""""""""""

- **Attach PDFs**: Want to be able to attach PDF files to your emails? Check the Enable box.

- **Invoice Link**: When you email an invoice to a client, the invoice is viewable via a web link that is embedded in the notification email. The default link uses a URL from the Invoice Ninja site. If you wish to change the link to your own website or another subdomain, check the relevant box and enter the URL details.

Email Design
""""""""""""

- **Email Style**: You can make your emails look more professional by choosing a design layout. Select the desired style by opening the drop-down menu. Available styles are Plain (regular email layout), Light (graphical layout featuring light border) and Dark (graphical layout featuring dark border). To preview the different styles, click the question mark icon at the right end of the field.

- **Enable markup**: Want to give your clients the convenient option to pay you online with a direct link from the invoice notification email? Check Enable markup to add a payment link to the invoice email. Then, your clients can click through to submit an online payment.

Finished customizing your email settings? Click the green Save button to apply the new settings.
